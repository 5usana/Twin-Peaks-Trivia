Ideally this Trivia game would allow for 2 players with the rush of being timed. With the current MVP status, the layout is slightly different allowing only 1 player, and no time limit.

## Hurdles
Where should I begin? This project has been a wild ride, and it honestly took a village. With the guidance of staff and fellow students I was able to complete this Trivia game. Piecing together parts of code is my usual struggle, psuedocode really helped organize my thoughts. Meeting MVP functionality took the duration of the project but I was able to throw in a little style at the end.
